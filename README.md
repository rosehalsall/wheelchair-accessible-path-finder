# wheelchair-accessible-path-finder
A-Level Coursework from 2019. 
Since completing this work, I would have changed  numerous things about this project:

- Firstly, I would use Java rather than Visual Basic (which was the only language I knew at the time of completion). This would have allowed me to better implement OOP and also make the initialisation of graphs much more efficient, as I would make each node an object and create them dynamically when necessary within the algorithm. This would prevent making an unnecessarily large graph. This would also allow the project to be expanded, making it useful to more people. 

- Implement the program within a web application, making it much easier for for users to use the resource and benefit from it. 

- Make the map graphics clickable, so that a dropdown textbox isn't necessary.
